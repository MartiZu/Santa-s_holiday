## Feliz Navihack - working toghether in a team of 3 over 7hours designing and creating a Christmas themed project! 

## Inspiration 
People always travel over Christmas to meet their loved ones to celebrate and spend time together! So here we are, helping Santa to travel to see people across the globe and spread the love - and that Christmas cash!!

## What it does
You can find a trip and see the best deal when to travel, to save money and buy more Christmas presents! However, if you have cash overflow, feel free to pick another date!

## How we built it
Using Next.js and Tailwind, creating a seamless user interface.

## Challenges we ran into
Agreeing to a tech stack and work with each other with a time limit was not easy. We had issues fetching data from our backend and using components from ShadCn library.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very happy about the app and the idea, it provides useful ideas and helps people to consider when to travel based on what is most important to them.

## What we learned
Working in a team and making sure we do pull requests and merge changes. Communicating and agreeing on short sprints and finalising the project before the deadline.

## What's next for The SleighLine (Team Kevin McCallister)
